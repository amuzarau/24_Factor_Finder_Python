# 24_Factor_Finder_Python
Factor Finder, program which finds factors for given number. My educational project from Al Sweigart book “The Big Book of Small Python Projects”.

A number’s factors are any two other numbers that, when multiplied with each other, 
produce the number. For example, 2 × 13 = 26, so 2 and 13 are factors of 26. Also, 1 × 26 = 26, 
so 1 and 26 are also factors of 26. Therefore, we say that 26 has four factors: 1, 2, 13, and 26.
If a number only has two factors (1 and itself), we call that a prime number. 
Otherwise, we call it a composite number.
